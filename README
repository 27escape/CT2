This directory contains the support files for my magic PDF generator "https://github.com/27escape/App-Basis-ConvertText2"

extra CSS, templates for the various document layouts and commands that can be added to the documents as
fenced code blocks

the templates are used at the top of a markdown file as so

template: book

most commands have info in them if they need extra things installing and you can try them out on the command line like

./command --has_content=1 --cachedir=/tmp --doc_ref="fred" < samples/command_sample_file
